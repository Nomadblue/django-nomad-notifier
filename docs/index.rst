the users of web apps that must receive updates from the site activity
through the following channels:

* **Email notifications**: usually *transactional emails* (messages like "Hi
  Frankie, Jimbo is now following you" or "You have unlocked a new level")
  but any type of email in practice.
* **Web notifications**: displayed/listed on UI ("ala" social apps such as
  Facebook or Google+). A list of notifications that can be marked as read.
